        We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
        Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
        Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
        Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
        Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
        Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
    </div>

        <p>The CSS id Selector <br>
        The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
        The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
        To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
